# Summer of Rat Genomics and Genetics (SuRGe) Workshop 2019

Please join us for two days in lovely Colorado to learn about rat genomics web resources including Rat Genome Database, GeneNetwork, GeneWeaver, PhenoGen, Omics Portal for Addiction Research, etc.  This workshop is sponsored by the NIDA Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (http://opar.io). 

Session will be separated into three phases: 1) identification of genomic regions of interest in rat, 2) exploring a rat genomic region in the context of addiction, and 3) examining genes of interest for further biological/molecular/physiological/behavioral information.

Session will be led by content area experts and majority of time will be spent doing hands-on activities. Presenters and coaches include: Rob Williams (UTHSC), Saunak Sen (UTHSC), Laura Saba (CU-AMC), Katerina Kechris (CU-AMC), and Jennifer Smith (RGD/MCW)

All participants must come with a genomic area of interest in the rat and/or a set of relevant genes. 

Event Address: Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, 12850 East Montview Blvd, Aurora CO 80045

If you have any questions, please contact us at Laura.Saba@cuanschutz.edu
